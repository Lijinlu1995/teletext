Test part:
This part mainly to test the source code, using the assert function to test whether the value have been initialize or assignment right. As for the test (1000) characters diaplay, I choose use the sampling check.

How to test:
command: make test
         ./test

Test functions:
1.test open File:

2.test state init: test the initialize of the state, newline on teletext page begins with white text, single height, black background, release graphics.

3.test set mode: test whether after the set mode the state have been the right statement.

4.test set background colour.

5.test test set height mode.

6.test set hode mode.

7.test set Matrix State: Using the sampling check to test certain point state, test the set of front colour, back colour, dismode, heightmode, hold mode (m[18][31] is hold control after that control codes are instead displayed as copy of most recently graphices until meet the release control code).

8.test read font file: m7fixed_data.h has all the hex data in the fnt file and this function is to check whether the read fnt file right.

9.test read mode7 file: test_m7data.h has all the hex data in the mode7 file (1000 charactors) and this function is to check whether the read fnt file right.

Bugs have been solved:
1. SDL window flash back and show print only line by line bug
2. only display with colour white and black
3. also print the control code in a strange style
4. double-height print two same line with single height
5. hold graphics does not being reset to space(0xA0) after the change of display or height mode
6. contiguous graphics cannot display the character correctly
